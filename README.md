explaination for 1st code
Here, two lists are created:
years: Contains strings representing significant years or decades in the history of AI/ML.
events: Contains strings representing notable events and breakthroughs in AI/ML corresponding to the years in the years list.
plt.plot is used to plot the points on the graph:
years provides the x-coordinates.
[1]*len(years) creates a list of y-coordinates, all set to 1. This results in a horizontal line at y=1.
"ro" specifies that the points should be plotted as red circles ("r" for red, "o" for circle marker).
This loop iterates over the events list and annotates each point with the corresponding event name:
years[i] and 1.02 specify the coordinates where the text should appear, slightly above the points.
events[i] is the text that will be displayed.
rotation=45 rotates the text by 45 degrees for better alignment.
ha='right' horizontally aligns the text to the right.
fontsize=9 sets the font size of the text.
eneral Functionality
Visualization: The code creates a visual timeline to depict the evolution of AI/ML.
Points: Each significant year/decade is marked with a red circle.
Annotations: Each point is labeled with the corresponding breakthrough or event, rotated for readability.
Customization: The plot includes a title, hides the y-axis ticks, and adds a grid for better visual appeal.
Additional Considerations
Clarity: Rotating the labels (texts) and aligning them to the right helps in making the timeline clear and easy to read.
Conciseness: The figure size and other parameters provide a compact and concise visualization suitable for embedding into reports or presentations.
